The Boeing 737 Max crashes that occurred in 2018 and 2019 due to a failure of the MCAS software system provide a case study for the ethical questions that arise when developing technological solutions that have implications far beyond their technological purpose. This case study provides insight into implications of engineering decisions that are made with regards to real-world systems. Lessons learned from this study provide useful guidelines for how individually contributing engineers as well as leaders and policy-makers can improve the introduction of new technologies to the public. 

Key ethical dilemmas faced during the Boeing 737 Max Incidents: 
1. How should Boeing balance profit and design time? 
2. How should engineers respond to instruction from leadership? 
3. What changes about an aircraft’s design should Boeing be required to release to airlines and the public? 
4. Should Boeing be responsible for compensating the victims’ families? 
5. Should the federal government enforce whistleblower protections? 

American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code of Ethics Cannons that apply to the above questions are : 
-  Cannon 1: “Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public in the performance of their professional duties” 
- Cannon 4: “Engineers shall act in professional matters for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees and shall avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest” 
- Cannon 5: “Engineers shall respect the proprietary information and intellectual property rights of others, including charitable organizations and professional societies in the engineering field”
- Cannon 9: “Engineers shall not seek ethical sanction against another engineer unless there is good reason to do so under the relevant codes, policies, and procedures governing that engineer’s ethical conduct. 


Key Stakeholders: 
How should Boeing balance profit and design time? 
- Primary: Boeing engineers, airline passengers, pilots, Boeing investors 
- Secondary: Airlines, families 
- Decision-makers: Boeing management and individually contributing engineers 
How should engineers respond to instruction from leadership? 
- Primary: Design engineers, Boeing shareholders, Boeing management 
- Secondary: Passengers, victims’ families, airlines, pilots 
- Decision-makers: Boeing engineers 
What changes about an aircraft’s design should Boeing be required to release to airlines and the public? 
- Primary: Boeing executives & management, pilots 
- Secondary: engineers, passengers, families, the FAA 
- Decision makers: engineers, Boeing executives & management, the FAA 
Should Boeing be responsible for compensating the victims’ families? 
- Primary: Victims’ families, Boeing leadership 
- Secondary: the public 
- Decision makers: Boeing leadership 
Should the federal government enforce whistleblower protections? 
- Primary: the FAA, Boeing leadership, Boeing engineers 
- Secondary: the public, airline pilots, airlines, passengers 
- Decision Makers: the FAA, government agencies 

Exploration of Ethical Questions and Proposed solutions: 
1. How should Boeing balance profit and design time? 
In a competitive market economy, companies often prioritize profit and their market dominance over their competitors; this drives technological innovation. In the case of the Boeing 737 Max, though, the decreased timeline and corner cutting to achieve it did not lead to innovation or increased safety, but rather an under-tested system that resulted in two plane crashes. There is no ASME Cannon that explicitly protects company profits. Instead, Cannon 1 holds paramount the safety of the public. Therefore, the company must hold the public’s safety as the top priority over a faster design time that could increase profits. In Boeing’s case, they should have taken the extra time to either 1 better integrate the new engines onto their old fuselage from a structural engineering standpoint or 2 taken the time to flesh out the control issues in the MCAS software. 

2. How should engineers respond to instruction from leadership? 
In this scenario, Boeing engineers should have voiced their concerns about any potential problems with the MCAS system. Engineers may have assumed that regulatory oversight would catch potential design flaws or even that the voicing of their opinion would not have had any significant influence on the company. Coupled with voicing their opinions, the company itself should cultivate a culture of transparency and commitment to investigating issues brought up by any employee. THis will foster a mindset amongst engineers to voice their opinions both to other colleagues and to company leadership if they believe there is an engineering system that could jeopardize public safety. 

3. What changes about an aircraft’s design should Boeing be required to release to airlines and the public? 
Any critical information that is required for the safe operation of a new technology should be disseminated to the relevant stakeholders including airlines, pilots, and regulatory bodies. Withholding critical information in order to trim down production and/or testing timelines is detrimental if the consequences compromise the public’s safety, again referring to Cannon 1 of the ASME Code of Ethics. 

4. Should Boeing be responsible for compensating the victims’ families?
Yes, Boeing should take responsibility for the crashes that occurred because critical information about their flight system was not disclosed. Admitting to being responsible for this crisis could lead to additional internal investigations that reveal more ways that the company could improve its internal processes. In addition to compensating the victims’ families, the company should re-evaluate, along with governmental regulatory bodies, how to prevent similar tragedies from occurring again in the future. 

5. Should the federal government enforce whistleblower protections? 
This will encourage engineers to speak up if they believe an engineering system could cause risk to the public. This is a potential solution to safeguard Canon 1 of the ASME Code of Ethics. 


Take-aways: 
A key lesson learned from this case study is the importance of transparency and quality of communication, both technical communication and interpersonal communication amongst engineers, business leadership, company partners, customers, and the public in order to foster a culture that promotes public safety while allowing technology to flourish.
