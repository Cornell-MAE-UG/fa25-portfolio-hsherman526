## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/headshot_spring23.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Hannah, and I'm driven by a desire to make the world a better place, whether that be through engineering, mentorship, or volunteer work in my community. I am a fourth-year student at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. 

Through project team, research, classwork, and internship experience, I've developed technical skills in mechanical design, analysis, and testing as well as learned the power of hard work, grit, and collaboration. 

Outside of academics, I'm a classically trained ballet dancer, but currently do contemporary dance and choreography at school. 
Please feel free to reach out, I'd love to connect: hms256@cornell.edu
